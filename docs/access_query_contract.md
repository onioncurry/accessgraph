# AccessGraph — Query Contract (Person 3 ↔ Person 2 ↔ Person 1)

The interface between the G-Brain Access Graph (Person 3), the
`task_access_assistant` skill (Person 2), and the UI (Person 1). This is locked —
build against it in parallel. Types: [`lib/types.ts`](../lib/types.ts).

---

## The one function Person 2 calls

```ts
import { resolveAccess, loadGraph } from "../../lib/mockAccess.ts";
const pkg = resolveAccess(input);          // AccessPackage
```

- CLI check: `npm run demo` / `node scripts/query.ts --input '<json>'`
- Golden input/output: [`contract/sample_query.json`](../contract/sample_query.json) → [`contract/sample_response.json`](../contract/sample_response.json)
- Golden test cases incl. expected permissions: [`data/task_examples.json`](../data/task_examples.json)

Person 2 owns the **task parser** (Slack/Teams message → `TaskInput`).
Person 3 owns everything from `TaskInput` onward.

---

## INPUT — `TaskInput` (Person 2's parser produces this)

```json
{
  "assignee": "Rei_Kawaji",
  "project": "phoenix",
  "intent": "continue_progress",
  "keywords": ["product", "progress"],
  "raw_text": "Help Rei continue the product progress and share the docs she needs."
}
```

- `assignee` (required): name, id, handle (`Rei_Kawaji`), or email — fuzzy-matched.
  In a DM, the assignee is the *other* participant; in a channel mention, parse
  from the message.
- `project`, `intent`, `keywords`, `raw_text` optional — resolver degrades
  gracefully to keyword + project matching.

### `intent` → read vs write

| intent | treated as | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `read` / `review` / `investigate` (or empty) | read | everything read-only |
| `update` / `continue_progress` | write | **work_surface** resources get write; **reference** resources stay read-only |

That per-resource split (`intent_role` in resources.json) is the least-privilege
core: a write task does NOT mean editor everywhere.

---

## OUTPUT — `AccessPackage`

See the full golden output: [`contract/sample_response.json`](../contract/sample_response.json).
Shape (abridged):

```json
{
  "skill": "task_access_assistant",
  "task": { "assignee": "Rei Kawaji", "project": "Project Phoenix", "intent": "continue_progress" },
  "summary": { "resources_found": 5, "missing": 5, "already_has": 0, "blocked": 0 },
  "required_access": [
    {
      "resource": "Project Phoenix - Product Brief",
      "resource_id": "product-brief",
      "system": "Google Docs",
      "icon": "gdocs",
      "owner": "Shota Gushima",
      "status": "missing",
      "recommended_permission": "viewer",
      "duration": "7 days",
      "approval_required": true,
      "approver": "Shota Gushima",
      "approver_email": "shota.gushima@northwind.ai",
      "reason": "Needed to read (reference) for Project Phoenix work: ...",
      "request_message": "Hi Shota, Rei Kawaji needs Viewer access to ... Approve?"
    }
  ],
  "next_action": "prepare_access_request"
}
```

### How Person 1 maps this to the "Auto-share for this task" panel

| AccessPackage | UI |
|---|---|
| `required_access[]` (status `missing`) | checked rows with `icon` + `resource` + `system` |
| `summary.missing` | **Share all (N)** button count |
| `request_message` | sent on **Share all** / shown under **Review** |
| `status: "blocked"` rows | excluded from Share all; show lock + `reason` |
| `status: "has_access"` rows | hidden or shown greyed with ✓ |

### `status` semantics

- `missing` — needs a grant; has `recommended_permission`, `approver`, `request_message`.
  **Includes upgrades**: if the assignee has `viewer` but the task needs `editor`,
  status is `missing` with `current_permission` set and the reason noting the upgrade.
- `has_access` — current level is **sufficient for the task's needed level** (ranked:
  viewer/read/member < editor/contributor/write < owner); no approver, no request
- `blocked` — confidential (`never_auto_grant`); surfaced but **never** auto-bundled;
  approver = assignee's **manager**. Unblocking requires BOTH a project match AND
  explicit keyword evidence in the task — a bare `project` claim is not enough.

### `next_action` semantics

- `prepare_access_request` — at least one grant needed
- `no_action_needed` — resources found, all sufficient
- `clarify_assignee` — assignee unknown or ambiguous (2-char fragments are rejected)
- `clarify_task` — **0 resources matched**; the task was too vague to map. Agents
  must ask, not treat this as done.

## Guarantees (Person 3) — enforced by `npm test` (34 adversarial cases)

1. **Deterministic** — same input, same output. Demo-safe.
2. **Least privilege** — per-resource, via `intent_role` × policy; garbage/unknown
   intents degrade to read-only; under-privilege surfaces as an upgrade.
3. **Confidential-safe** — customer data never silently granted; never writable;
   project-claim alone cannot unlock it.
4. **Fail-closed** — a resource type with no policy still requires approval.
5. **Every grant has an approver** — no dangling requests (manager-less assignees
   fall back to the resource owner).
6. **Injection-inert** — attacker-controlled text is sanitized before being echoed;
   10KB/unicode/emoji inputs don't degrade discovery.
